# doo

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/bensu/doo.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/bensu/doo)

A library and Leiningen plugin to run `cljs.test` in many JS environments.

>  ...and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids.

This README is for the latest release:

`[lein-doo 0.1.6-SNAPSHOT]`

which contains experimental features. The latest stable version is:
`[lein-doo 0.1.4]` and the docs are [here](https://github.com/bensu/doo/blob/master/README_STABLE.md).

To use doo you need to use `[org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-3308"]` or
newer.

## Usage

### Plugin

    lein doo {js-env}
    
    lein doo {js-env} {build-id}

    lein doo {js-env} {build-id} {watch-mode}

* `js-env` can be any `chrome`, `firefox`, `ie`, `safari`, `opera`,
`slimer`, `phantom`, `node`, or `rhino`. In the future it 
is planned to support `v8`, `jscore`, and others. 
* `watch-mode` (optional): either `auto` (default) or `once` which
  exits with 0 if the tests were successful and 1 if they failed.
* `build-id` is one of your `cljsbuild` profiles. For example `test` from:

```clj
:cljsbuild
  {:builds [{:id "test"
             :source-paths ["src" "test"]
             :compiler {:output-to "resources/public/js/testable.js"
                        :main your-project.runner
                        :optimizations :none}}]}
```

Notice that `:main` is set to the namespace `your-project.runner`
where you define which test namespaces you want to run, using:

```clj
(ns your-project.runner
    (:require [doo.runner :refer-macros [doo-tests]]
              [your-project.core-test]
              [your-project.util-test]))

(doo-tests 'your-project.core-test
           'your-project.util-test)
```

`doo.runner/doo-tests` works just like `cljs.test/run-tests` but it places hooks
around the tests to know when to start them and finish them. Since it
is a macro that will be calling said namespaces, you need to require
them in `your-project.runner` even if you don't call any of their
functions. You can also call `(doo.runner/doo-all-tests)` which wraps
`cljs.test/run-all-tests` to run tests in all loaded namespaces.
Notice that `doo-tests` needs to be called in the top level and can't
be called inside a function (unless you explicitly call that function
in the top level).

Then you can run:

    lein doo slimer test

which starts an ClojureScript autobuilder for the `test` profile and
runs `slimerjs` on it when it's done.

You can also call `doo` without a `build-id` (as in `lein doo phantom`) as
long as you specify a [Default Build](#default-build) in your `project.clj`.

### Boot

`doo` is packaged as a Boot task in [boot-cljs-test](https://github.com/crisptrutski/boot-cljs-test).

### Library

To run a JavaScript file in your preferred runner you can directly call
`doo.core/run-script` from Clojure:

```clj
(require '[doo.core :as doo])

(let [doo-opts {:paths {:karma "karma"}}
      compiler-opts {:output-to "out/testable.js"
                     :optimizations :none}] 
  (doo/run-script :phantom compiler-opts doo-opts))
```

## Setting up Environments

This is the hardest part and `doo` doesn't do it for you (yet?). Right
now if you want to run
[`slimer`](http://docs.slimerjs.org/current/installation.html),
[`phantom`](http://phantomjs.org/download.html), or [`node`](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation) you need to install them
so that these commands work on the command line:

    phantomjs -v

    slimerjs -v

    node -v

    rhino -help

If you want to use a different command to run a certain runner, see
Paths.

> Remember that Rhino and Node don't come with a DOM so you can't call the
> window or document objects. They are meant to test functions and
> logic, not rendering.

### Slimer & Phantom

If you want to run both, use `lein doo headless {build-id} {watch-mode}`.

Do not install Slimer with homebrew unless you know what you
are doing. There are
[reports](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojurescript/4EF-NAzu-kM)
of it not working with ClojureScript when installed that way because
of dated versions.

> Note: Slimer does not
> [currently](https://github.com/laurentj/slimerjs/pull/278) throw
> error exit codes when encountering an error, which makes them
> unsuitable for CI testing.

### Node

Some requirements:

* Minimum node version required: `0.12`
* `:output-dir` is needed whenever you are using `:none`.
* `:target :nodejs` is always needed.

```clj
:node-test {:source-paths ["src" "test"]
            :compiler {:output-to "target/testable.js"
                       :output-dir "target"
                       :main example.runner
                       :target :nodejs}}
```

### Karma (experimental)

#### Installation

[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html)
is a comprehensive JavaScript test runner. It uses
[plugins](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/dev/plugins.html) to
extend functionality. We are interested in several "launcher" plugins
which start a browser on command. You might **want** any of:

    - karma-chrome-launcher
    - karma-firefox-launcher
    - karma-safari-launcher
    - karma-opera-launcher
    - karma-ie-launcher 

Alternatively, if you don't want `doo` to launch the browsers for you,
you can always launch them yourself and navigate to
[http://localhost:9876](http://localhost:9876) 

We also need to properly report `cljs.test` results inside Karma.
We'll **need** a "framework" plugin:

    - karma-cljs-test

Karma and its plugins are installed with `npm`, globally
with `npm install -g karma`, or locally to
the project with `npm install karma`. These alternatives can't be
combined: you can't install `karma` globally and then install
`karma-chrome-launcher` locally. The local option is recommended.
For local installation run:

    npm install karma karma-cljs-test --save-dev

and then install any of the launchers you'll use:

    npm install karma-chrome-launcher karma-firefox-launcher --save-dev
    npm install karma-safari-launcher karma-opera-launcher --save-dev
    npm install karma-ie-launcher --save-dev

The `--save-dev` option informs `npm` that you only need the packages
during development and not when packaging artifacts.

The installation will generate a `node-modules` folder with all the
installed modules. It is recommended to add `node-modules` to your
`.gitignore`. 

If you are using `lein-npm`, follow their
[instructions](https://github.com/RyanMcG/lein-npm).

If you are using a local installation and `node_modules` is not located
at the project root, you need to tell `doo` about it. Add this to your
`project.clj`:

```clj
:doo {:paths {:karma "path/to/node_modules/karma/bin/karma"}}

:cljsbuild { your-builds }
```

and make sure that the file `karma/bin/karma` exists inside
`node_modules`.

For global installation, run the same commands but add the `-g` option
as in `npm install -g karma`. Then, you need to inform `doo`, add this
to your `project.clj`:

```clj
:doo {:paths {:karma "karma"}} ;; => resolve :karma's path to "karma"

:cljsbuild { your-builds }
```

For more info on `:paths` see Paths.

Global installation will allow you to
use karma in all of your projects. The problem is that it won't be
explicitly configured in your project that karma is used for testing,
which makes it harder for new contributors to setup.

> In some systems (e.g. Ubuntu) you might need to run all npm commands
> as root:
> 	sudo npm install karma --save-dev

## Paths

You might want to use a different version of node, or the global
version of Karma, or any other binary to run your tests for a given
environment. You can configure that paths like so:

```clj
:doo {:paths {:node "user/local/bin/node12"
              :karma "./frontend/node_modules/karma/bin/karma"}

:cljsbuild { your-builds }
```

Paths can also be used to pass command line arguments to the runners:

```clj
:doo {:paths {:phantom "phantomjs --web-security=false"
              :slimer "slimerjs --ignore-ssl-errors=true"
              :karma "karma --port=9881 --no-colors"
              :rhino "rhino -strict"
              :node "node --trace-gc --trace-gc-verbose"}}
```

## Aliases

You might want to group runners and call
them from the command line. For example, while developing you might
only be interested in `chrome` and `firefox`, but you also want to
test with `safari` before doing a deploy:

```clj
:doo {:alias {:browsers [:chrome :firefox]
              :all [:browsers :safari]}}

:cljsbuild { my-builds }
```

Then you can use:

```sh
lein doo browsers my-build  # runs chrome and firefox

lein doo all my-build # runs chrome, firefox, and safari
```

As you can see, aliases can be recursively defined: watch for circular
dependencies or `doo` will bark.

The only built-in alias is `:headless [:phantom :slimer]`.

## Default Build

To save you one command line argument, `lein-doo` lets you specify a
default build in your `project.clj`:

```clj
:doo {:build "some-build-id"
      :paths { ... }
      :alias { ... }}

:cljsbuild
  {:builds [{:id "some-build-id"
             :source-paths ["src" "test"]
             :compiler {:output-to "out/testable.js"
                        :optimizations :none
                        :main example.runner}}]}
```

## Travis CI

To run on [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) there is a sample `.travis.yml` file in the example project: [example/.travis.yml](example/.travis.yml)

(Currently only tested with PhantomJS.)

## Changes

* `0.1.6-SNAPSHOT` includes many internal changes. While all the
  changes are backwards compatible, regressions are expected:
  * Adds the `:verbose` option to `doo.core/run-script`
  * Removes `cljsbuild` as a dependency.
  * Swaps `selmer` for `data.json`.
  * Supports `'example.runner` `"example.runner"`, and
    `example.runner` as options to `:main`.
  * Removes limitations around absolute and relative paths for
     `doo.core/run-script` and the `compiler-options`.
  * Pass command line arguments to runners through `:paths`.
  * In auto mode, run karma as a server to avoid starting/stopping the
    browsers.
  * Add the Default Builds under `:doo {:build "build-id"}` in
    `project.clj`.
* `0.1.5-SNAPSHOT` adds Karma with `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`,
  `opera`, and `ie` as runners, adds custom `:paths` for the runners,
  adds custom `:alias`, deletes the `browser` alias and replaces it with
  `headless` for `slimer` and `phantom`, and changes once again the
  signature for `doo.core/run-script`. 
* `0.1.4-SNAPSHOT` allows `:optimizations :none` for all platforms but
  `rhino`, changes `valid-compiler-options?`'s signature to take
  `js-env`, adds the `browsers` alias, and changes many of the
  compiler requirements.
* `0.1.3-SNAPSHOT` adds support for absolute paths in the runners and
  allows projects to use node dependencies through `lein-npm`.
  Requires `node => 0.12`.
* `0.1.2-SNAPSHOT` adds `node` support and changed `run-script`'s interface.
* `0.1.1-SNAPSHOT` adds the option for `once` and returns an UNIX exit
code reflecting if the tests failed, to be used in CI builds. It also
**requires [org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-3308"]** or newer.
